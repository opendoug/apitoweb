A basic framework for getting public API data into a web page

Up until now I've only used Google Sheets and Google Apps Script to GET data via an API. New projects I'm working on will require me to GET data via an API and embed it into a webpage. This repo contains my initial working HTML, JS, and CSS templates using the JSONPlaceholder
Fake Online REST API for Testing and Prototyping (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). Future iterations will include OAuth2 support, combinations of text and images, additional styling using CSS Grid/Flexbox/etc., and other improvements as I see fit.

Developers are welcome to use this foundation in their own projects *and* share their improvements.
